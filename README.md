# Create a file from input

- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

### Write an app that will create a file with a given name and content.

- When the app is launched, ask the user to enter the file name.
- When the name is provided, ask to enter next line of the content
in a while loop until user enters `stop`.
- When the user completes interaction, create a file with name and
fill it with content provided by user. File extension should be `txt`.

Example:
```python
Enter name of the file: name1
Enter new line of content: This is the first line of content
Enter new line of content: This is the second
Enter new line of content: stop
# File name: "name1.txt"
# File content:
# This is the first line of content
# This is the second
```
